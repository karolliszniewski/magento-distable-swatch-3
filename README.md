In Magento 2, the type of an image (e.g., thumbnail, small_image, swatch_image, etc.) is set as an attribute on the product's media gallery entry. This attribute allows Magento to determine how each image is used in various contexts on the storefront and admin. When you're uploading an image in a custom module and want to specify or change its type, you can do so by setting the correct attributes on the media gallery entry.

Here's how you can address this issue:

1. Understanding Image Types in Magento
Magento uses certain predefined types to classify images:

Base Image (image): The main image of the product.
Small Image (small_image): Used in product listings and category pages.
Thumbnail (thumbnail): Used in shopping cart, related products, etc.
Swatch Image (swatch_image): Specifically used for visual swatches in layered navigation and product options.
If an image is incorrectly assigned the swatch_image role, it may result in unexpected behavior, especially if your product or attribute configuration doesn’t require swatches.

2. Setting Image Types in Code
When saving an image, you can explicitly set the roles (or types) of the image, and omit swatch_image unless it’s required. Here’s an example of how to programmatically set image types while avoiding the swatch_image attribute.

Example: Adding Image Without swatch_image
In your Save controller or model, specify the image roles directly:

php
Copy code
use Magento\Catalog\Api\ProductRepositoryInterface;
use Magento\Catalog\Model\Product;
use Magento\Framework\App\Filesystem\DirectoryList;

class SaveImageRole
{
    protected $productRepository;

    public function __construct(
        ProductRepositoryInterface $productRepository
    ) {
        $this->productRepository = $productRepository;
    }

    public function execute($productId, $filePath)
    {
        $product = $this->productRepository->getById($productId);

        // Add image to media gallery and set specific roles
        $product->addImageToMediaGallery(
            $filePath,
            ['image', 'small_image', 'thumbnail'], // Specify roles, excluding `swatch_image`
            false,
            false
        );

        $this->productRepository->save($product);
    }
}
In this example, the image is set as the image, small_image, and thumbnail, not swatch_image. This prevents Magento from treating it as a swatch.

3. Removing swatch_image Role if It Was Previously Assigned
If an image was previously set with the swatch_image role and you want to remove it, you can reset or update the image roles on the product.

Example: Removing swatch_image from an Existing Image
To remove an existing swatch_image role from an image, retrieve the product's media gallery, identify the image, and update its roles:

php
Copy code
use Magento\Catalog\Api\ProductRepositoryInterface;
use Magento\Catalog\Model\Product\Gallery\Entry;
use Magento\Framework\App\Filesystem\DirectoryList;

class RemoveSwatchImage
{
    protected $productRepository;

    public function __construct(
        ProductRepositoryInterface $productRepository
    ) {
        $this->productRepository = $productRepository;
    }

    public function execute($productId)
    {
        $product = $this->productRepository->getById($productId);
        $mediaGallery = $product->getMediaGalleryEntries();

        foreach ($mediaGallery as $key => $entry) {
            // Check if this entry is set as swatch_image
            if (in_array('swatch_image', $entry->getTypes())) {
                // Update the entry to remove swatch_image, set new types
                $entry->setTypes(['image', 'small_image', 'thumbnail']); // or any types needed
            }
        }

        $product->setMediaGalleryEntries($mediaGallery);
        $this->productRepository->save($product);
    }
}
In this code:

We loop through each media gallery entry and check if the swatch_image role is assigned.
If swatch_image is found, we update the types attribute to exclude it, replacing it with other types such as image, small_image, or thumbnail.
Finally, the product’s media gallery entries are saved without the swatch_image role.
4. Summary
Define Roles Explicitly on Upload: When adding an image, specify the roles directly in your addImageToMediaGallery function to avoid assigning swatch_image by mistake.
Remove swatch_image if Already Set: If the image already has the swatch_image role, retrieve the media gallery, modify the types for that image entry, and save it back without swatch_image.
Verify Product Attribute Configuration: If the error persists, ensure that no attributes are configured as visual swatches unless required. This is under Stores > Attributes > Product.
By controlling the image roles during upload and updating them as needed, you can prevent Magento from assigning unintended roles like swatch_image and avoid the associated errors.

but is not product but custom post because is custom blog module

For a custom blog module, the approach is a bit different because you're not dealing with Magento's built-in product media gallery, which has predefined roles like swatch_image, thumbnail, etc. Instead, you’ll need to create your own logic for handling image types in your blog posts.

Here's a breakdown of how to implement a custom image upload feature with configurable image types in a custom blog module:

Steps to Set Up Custom Image Types in a Blog Module
Database Structure for Image Types:

Add a column to your custom blog post table to store the image type. This way, each uploaded image can have its type (e.g., thumbnail, banner, gallery, etc.) associated with it.
You might have a separate table to store multiple images per post if needed, along with their types.
Here’s an example of a table structure:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE custom_blog_images (
    image_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    post_id INT NOT NULL,
    image_path VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    image_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (post_id) REFERENCES custom_blog_posts(post_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
Admin Form for Image Upload:

In your admin form, create fields for uploading images and selecting the image type.
Use a dropdown or a set of checkboxes for the admin user to specify whether the uploaded image should be used as a thumbnail, banner, gallery, etc.
Saving the Image with Its Type:

When saving the blog post, handle the image upload and store the image with the selected type in your database.
Here’s an example of handling the file upload and saving it along with its type in your Save controller:

php
Copy code
use Magento\Backend\App\Action;
use Magento\Framework\App\Filesystem\DirectoryList;
use Magento\MediaStorage\Model\File\UploaderFactory;
use Magento\Framework\Filesystem;
use Custom\Blog\Model\ImageRepository; // Custom repository for handling image entries

class Save extends Action
{
    protected $uploaderFactory;
    protected $filesystem;
    protected $imageRepository;

    public function __construct(
        Action\Context $context,
        UploaderFactory $uploaderFactory,
        Filesystem $filesystem,
        ImageRepository $imageRepository
    ) {
        parent::__construct($context);
        $this->uploaderFactory = $uploaderFactory;
        $this->filesystem = $filesystem;
        $this->imageRepository = $imageRepository;
    }

    public function execute()
    {
        // Retrieve post data and image type
        $data = $this->getRequest()->getPostValue();
        $postId = $data['post_id'];
        $imageType = $data['image_type']; // E.g., 'thumbnail', 'banner', etc.

        // Handle image upload
        if (isset($_FILES['image']['name']) && $_FILES['image']['name'] != '') {
            $uploader = $this->uploaderFactory->create(['fileId' => 'image']);
            $uploader->setAllowedExtensions(['jpg', 'jpeg', 'gif', 'png']);
            $uploader->setAllowRenameFiles(true);
            $uploader->setFilesDispersion(false);

            $mediaDirectory = $this->filesystem->getDirectoryWrite(DirectoryList::MEDIA);
            $targetPath = $mediaDirectory->getAbsolutePath('blog/images');
            $result = $uploader->save($targetPath);

            if ($result['file']) {
                $imagePath = 'blog/images/' . $result['file'];

                // Save image path and type in the database
                $this->imageRepository->saveImage($postId, $imagePath, $imageType);
            }
        }

        // Redirect or display success message
        $this->messageManager->addSuccessMessage(__('The image has been saved.'));
        return $this->_redirect('*/*/edit', ['id' => $postId]);
    }
}
Custom Image Repository:

Create a repository or model that handles saving and retrieving images based on their types for each blog post.
php
Copy code
namespace Custom\Blog\Model;

use Custom\Blog\Model\ResourceModel\Image as ImageResource;
use Custom\Blog\Model\ImageFactory;

class ImageRepository
{
    protected $imageFactory;
    protected $imageResource;

    public function __construct(
        ImageFactory $imageFactory,
        ImageResource $imageResource
    ) {
        $this->imageFactory = $imageFactory;
        $this->imageResource = $imageResource;
    }

    public function saveImage($postId, $imagePath, $imageType)
    {
        $image = $this->imageFactory->create();
        $image->setData([
            'post_id' => $postId,
            'image_path' => $imagePath,
            'image_type' => $imageType
        ]);
        $this->imageResource->save($image);
    }

    public function getImagesByType($postId, $imageType)
    {
        // Logic to retrieve images by type for a specific post
    }
}
Displaying Images Based on Type in the Frontend:

When rendering a blog post, use your ImageRepository to retrieve images by their type (e.g., thumbnail or gallery) and display them accordingly.
Backend Grid with Image Types:

In your admin grid for blog posts, you can add columns that show the available image types for each post, making it clear what images are set as thumbnail, banner, etc.
Example Usage
In your frontend templates, you can retrieve images by type and display them accordingly, e.g., displaying the thumbnail image:

php
Copy code
$thumbnailImage = $imageRepository->getImagesByType($post->getId(), 'thumbnail');
This setup provides flexibility, allowing you to manage various image roles for each blog post, and avoids conflicts with predefined roles like swatch_image that are only relevant for products.

but there can be multiple types of images nad use schema.xml to create db table
ChatGPT said:

When you want to support multiple types of images (like thumbnail, gallery, banner, etc.) for a custom module in Magento 2 and create the database structure via db_schema.xml, you can do so by setting up a table to store the image paths along with their types. This way, you allow each blog post to have multiple images, each classified by type.

Here's how you can create a setup for this:

1. Create Database Table via db_schema.xml
Define the database table in db_schema.xml for your custom module. This XML file will create a table that allows each post to have multiple images of different types.

Example db_schema.xml:
xml
Copy code
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<schema xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:framework:Setup/Declaration/Schema/etc/schema.xsd">
    <table name="custom_blog_images" resource="default" engine="innodb" comment="Blog Post Images">
        <column xsi:type="int" name="image_id" nullable="false" unsigned="true" identity="true" comment="Image ID"/>
        <column xsi:type="int" name="post_id" nullable="false" unsigned="true" comment="Post ID"/>
        <column xsi:type="varchar" name="image_path" nullable="false" length="255" comment="Image Path"/>
        <column xsi:type="varchar" name="image_type" nullable="false" length="50" comment="Image Type"/>
        <column xsi:type="timestamp" name="created_at" nullable="false" default="CURRENT_TIMESTAMP" on_update="false" comment="Creation Time"/>
        
        <constraint xsi:type="primary" referenceId="PRIMARY">
            <column name="image_id"/>
        </constraint>
        <constraint xsi:type="foreign" referenceId="FK_CUSTOM_BLOG_IMAGES_POST_ID" table="custom_blog_images" column="post_id" 
                   referenceTable="custom_blog_posts" referenceColumn="post_id" onDelete="CASCADE"/>
        
        <index referenceId="POST_ID_INDEX">
            <column name="post_id"/>
        </index>
    </table>
</schema>
In this table:

post_id: References the post_id in the custom_blog_posts table.
image_path: Stores the path of the uploaded image.
image_type: Stores the type of image (e.g., thumbnail, gallery, banner).
created_at: Records the timestamp for when the image was added.
2. Backend Form to Upload Images with Type Selection
In the admin form, add a file upload field for images and a dropdown to let users select the type of image they’re uploading. This will allow users to specify whether the image is a thumbnail, gallery, etc., before saving.

3. Saving Images and Types in the Save Controller
In the Save controller or model, handle the image upload, and save the image path and type in the database.

php
Copy code
use Magento\Framework\App\Filesystem\DirectoryList;
use Magento\MediaStorage\Model\File\UploaderFactory;
use Custom\Blog\Model\ImageRepository;

class Save extends \Magento\Backend\App\Action
{
    protected $uploaderFactory;
    protected $filesystem;
    protected $imageRepository;

    public function __construct(
        \Magento\Backend\App\Action\Context $context,
        UploaderFactory $uploaderFactory,
        \Magento\Framework\Filesystem $filesystem,
        ImageRepository $imageRepository
    ) {
        parent::__construct($context);
        $this->uploaderFactory = $uploaderFactory;
        $this->filesystem = $filesystem;
        $this->imageRepository = $imageRepository;
    }

    public function execute()
    {
        $data = $this->getRequest()->getPostValue();
        $postId = $data['post_id'];
        $imageType = $data['image_type']; // Selected image type from dropdown

        // Handle file upload
        if (isset($_FILES['image']['name']) && $_FILES['image']['name'] != '') {
            $uploader = $this->uploaderFactory->create(['fileId' => 'image']);
            $uploader->setAllowedExtensions(['jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'gif']);
            $uploader->setAllowRenameFiles(true);
            $mediaDirectory = $this->filesystem->getDirectoryWrite(DirectoryList::MEDIA);
            $targetPath = $mediaDirectory->getAbsolutePath('blog/images');
            $result = $uploader->save($targetPath);

            if ($result['file']) {
                $imagePath = 'blog/images/' . $result['file'];

                // Save image with type to the database
                $this->imageRepository->saveImage($postId, $imagePath, $imageType);
            }
        }

        $this->messageManager->addSuccessMessage(__('Image has been saved successfully.'));
        return $this->_redirect('*/*/edit', ['id' => $postId]);
    }
}
4. Image Repository to Manage Image Data
The ImageRepository will handle the interactions with the database table custom_blog_images.

php
Copy code
namespace Custom\Blog\Model;

use Custom\Blog\Model\ResourceModel\Image as ImageResource;
use Custom\Blog\Model\ImageFactory;

class ImageRepository
{
    protected $imageFactory;
    protected $imageResource;

    public function __construct(
        ImageFactory $imageFactory,
        ImageResource $imageResource
    ) {
        $this->imageFactory = $imageFactory;
        $this->imageResource = $imageResource;
    }

    public function saveImage($postId, $imagePath, $imageType)
    {
        $image = $this->imageFactory->create();
        $image->setData([
            'post_id' => $postId,
            'image_path' => $imagePath,
            'image_type' => $imageType
        ]);
        $this->imageResource->save($image);
    }

    public function getImagesByType($postId, $imageType)
    {
        // Custom code to retrieve images by type for a specific post
    }
}
5. Retrieving Images by Type in the Frontend
Use the getImagesByType method in ImageRepository to retrieve images for each blog post based on their type, making it easy to display thumbnail, gallery, or banner images in the appropriate locations.

php
Copy code
// Example usage in frontend template
$galleryImages = $imageRepository->getImagesByType($post->getId(), 'gallery');
Summary
Database Schema: Use db_schema.xml to define a table (custom_blog_images) that allows each post to have multiple images with types.
Admin Form: Add file upload and image type selection fields.
Save Controller: Handle the file upload and save image paths and types in the database.
Repository: Use a repository to manage image data and retrieve images by type when needed.
This setup provides flexibility for managing multiple image types per post while keeping the data organized and queryable.
